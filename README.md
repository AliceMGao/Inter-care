# Inter-care
RAIMDS is an international standard for comprehensive assessment and care planning used in nursing homes. Current processes and existing interfaces are semi-anachronistic that a unified digital workflow can improve. For our Systems Analysis and Design Class, my partner and I created a new user interface targeted at nurse stakeholders to enhance the user experience, concentrating on centralizing relevant patient data, expediting the assessment process, and improving communications on patient care.

Milestone I pdf summarizes our initial discussions and goals of improvement for the key stakeholder, containing everything from our earliest user story map of desired sections and capabilities of the platform, seen in the image above. There are also end-to-end scenarios and context diagrams of possible use among other stakeholders.

Following that, we storyboarded the whiteboard SVG process for how a nurse practitioner may utilize the software, hashing out desired workflows that our mock-up must deliver.

The final mock-up was completed through google slides and presented through one of our chosen case scenarios. Additional functionality details and thoughts on the UX design can be seen in the UI mock-up powerpoint.
